<h5>"A fertilizer is any material of natural or synthetic origin</h5>
<h5>that is applied to soils or to plant tissues to supply one or </h5>
<h5>more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants"</h5>

</center>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold">What are Fertilizers?</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Fertilizers are chemical substances supplied to the crops to increase their productivity. </li>
      <li>These are used by the farmers daily to increase the crop yield.</li> 
      <li>The fertilizers contain the essential nutrients required by the plants, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.</li> 
       <li>They enhance the water retention capacity of the soil and also increase its fertility.</li>
</ul><br/>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Types of Fertilizers</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold">1.Inorganic Fertilizers</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Inorganic fertilizers are chemical fertilizers that contain nutrient elements for the growth of crops made by chemical means. </li></ul>
  <span style="font-weight:bold">The inorganic fertilizers are of the following types:</span>
<h5 style="font-weight:bold">a.Nitrogen Fertilizers.</h5>

      <ul>
  <li>Nitrogen fertilizers contain nitrogen necessary for the development of crops. Nitrogen is the main constituent of chlorophyll that maintains a balance in the process of photosynthesis.</li>
    <li> It is also a part of amino acids in plants and constitutes protein.</li>
   <li> Nitrogen fertilizers improve the production and quality of agricultural products.</li>
   </ul>

  <h5 style="font-weight:bold"> b.Phosphorus Fertilizers.</h5>

        <ul>
      <li>The main nutrient in a phosphorus fertilizer is phosphorus. </li>
    <li>The efficiency of fertilizer depends upon effective phosphorus content, methods of fertilizing, properties of soil and crop strains.</li> 
   <li>Phosphorus found in the protoplasm of the cell plays an important role in cell growth and proliferation. </li>
     <li>The phosphorus fertilizer is beneficial for the growth of roots of the plants.</li>
  </ul>

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">2.Organic Fertilizers</h4>

      <ul>
   <li>Organic fertilizers are natural fertilizers obtained from plants and animals.</li>
    <li> It enriches the soil with carbonic compounds essential for plant growth.</li>
   <li> Organic fertilizers increase the organic matter content of the soil, promotes the reproduction of microorganisms, and changes the physical and chemical properties of the soil.</li>
  <li> It is considered to be one of the main nutrients for green food.</li>
  </ul>


<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Organic fertilizers can be obtained from the following products:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Agricultural Waste</li>

    <li>Livestock Manure</li>

    <li>Industrial Waste</i>

    <li>Municipal Sludge</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Advantages of Fertilizers</h4>

<div>The advantages of fertilizers are mentioned below:</div>

    <ol>
   <li>They are easy to transport, store, and apply.</li>

    <li>For supplying a specific nutrient we can select a specific fertilizer due to its nutrient specific nature.</li>

    <li>They are water-soluble and can easily dissolve in the soil. Hence, they are easily absorbed by the plants.</li>

    <li>They have a rapid effect on the crops.</li>

    <li>They increase the crop yield and provide enough food to feed the large population.</li>

    <li>They are predictable and reliable.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Disadvantages of Fertilizers</h4>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fertilizers have the following disadvantages:</span>

    <ol>
    <li>They are expensive.</li>

    <li>The ingredients in the fertilizers are toxic to the skin and respiratory system.</li>

    <li>Excessive use of fertilizers damages the plants and reduces soil fertility.</li>

    <li>Leaching occurs and the fertilizers reach the rivers causing eutrophication.</li>

    <li>Long term use reduces the microbial activity and disturbs the pH of the soil.</li>
</ol>


<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Uses of Fertilizers</h4>

<h6 style="font-weight:bold">Fertilizers are used for various purposes. The uses of fertilizers are mentioned below:</h4>

    <ol>
    <li>They are used to providing additional nutrients to the plants.</li>

    <li>They are added to improve the yield of the crops.</li>

    <li>Nitrogen-rich fertilizers are used for the greening of lawns.</li>

    <li>Organic fertilizers improve the texture and fertility of the soil.</li>

    <li>Gardeners use fertilizers to address certain needs of the plants such as nutritional needs.</li>

    <li>Fertilizers are added to potted plants to replace the lost nutrients.</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Importance of Fertilizers</h4>

    It is very difficult to meet the demands of the increasing population with such fewer resources. Loss of soil fertility, pests, and lack of nutrients has resulted in a decrease in agricultural production. This has increased the importance of fertilizers in agriculture.

<h6 style="font-weight:bold">Fertilizers can be important to the plants in the following ways:</h6>

    <ol>
      <li>Fertilizers increase plants’ tolerance towards pests. This has reduced their reliance on insecticides and herbicides, thereby, producing healthier crops. Consequently, diseases have reduced, providing aesthetic value to the crops.</li>

    <li>Fertilizers improve the water holding capacity of the plants and increase root depth.</li>

    <li>The potassium content present in the fertilizers strengthens the straws and stalks of the plants.</li>

    <li>The phosphorus present in the fertilizers helps in the faster development of roots and formation of seeds in the plants.</li>

    <li>Nitrogen in the fertilizers enhances the growth of the plants which can be characterized by the green colour of the plants.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

      Since the chemical fertilizers adversely affect soil fertility, biofertilizers were brought into use. These are substances that contain living or latent cells, and even micro-organisms. They provide the soil with the necessary nutrients and microbes for the growth of the plants. They help the soil to retain its fertility. They are environment-friendly and also destroy pathogenic components responsible for causing disease in plants. Acetobacter and Rhizobium are two such widely used biofertilizers.
<center><h3 style="color:green">Most commonly used Fertilizers</h3></center>
<h3 style="color:red">1.Urea</h3><br/>
<center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SPCJBMx/urea.jpg" alt="urea" border="0" width="250px"></a></center>


  <u><h4 style="color:green">Agricultural Use</h4></u><br/>
  <ul>
    <li>Superior Nitrogen content</li>
    <li>Low production cost, as source is natural</li>
    <li>Non-flammable and risk-free storage</li>
    <li>Wide application range, for all types of crops and soils</li>
    <li>Neutral pH and harmless to crops and soil</li>
</ul><br/>
<u><h4 style="color:green">How to Use Urea Fertilizer?</h4></u>
<ul>
   
    <li>Urea should be applied at the time of sowing. It should not come in contact with the seeds. It also can be applied as a top dressing.</li>
    <li>Since Urea is highly Nitrogen-concentrated, it should be used in combination with earth or sand before its application.</li>
    <li>Urea should not be applied when the soil contains free water or likely to remain wet for three or four days after application.</li>

</ul><br/>
<h3 style="color:red">2.Diammonium phosphate</h3>
<center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/f8K2s7n/Diammonium-phosphate.jpg" alt="Diammonium-phosphate" border="0" width="180px"></a></center>
<u><h4 style="color:green">Agricultural Use</h4></u>
<ul>
  <li>DAP [(NH4)2HPO4] is the world's most commonly used phosphorus fertilizer by growers today.</li> 
  <li>It is made from two common macronutrients (phosphate and nitrogen at 18N–46P2O5–0K2O content) </li> 
<li>It is popular because of its relatively highest concentration of phosphate and nitrogen content coupled with its excellent physical properties.</li>
 <li>It is widely used among farmers in the production of grain and row crops, such as corn, wheat, rye, and some lawn grasses</li>
</ul>
<u><h4 style="color:green">How to Use Diammonium phosphate Fertilizer?</h4></u>
  <ul>
    <li>It can be applied in autumn for tilling and in spring during sowing, as well as for pre-sowing cultivation.</li> 
      <li>Dissolving in soil, it provides temporary alkalization of pH of the soil solution around the fertilizer granule, thus stimulating better uptake of phosphorus from the fertilizers on acid soils.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:red">3.Potassium chloride</h3>
<center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DKB38z9/Potassium-chloride.jpg" alt="Potassium-chloride" border="0" width="250px"></a></center>
<u><h4 style="color:green">Agricultural Use</h4></u>
<ul>
 <li> Potassium chloride is the most widely applied K fertilizer because of its relatively low cost and because it includes more K than most other sources: 50 to 52 percent K (60 to 63 percent K₂O) and 45 to 47 percent Cl⁻. </li>
 <li>More than 90 percent of global potash production goes into plant nutrition.</li><li>Increase plant vigor and helps stiffen steams and aids in fruit formation. Muriate of Potash is great for your root and tuber crops like carrots, beets, and potatoes as it promotes healthy root growth.</li>
</ul>
<u><h4 style="color:green">How to Use Potassium chloride?</h4></u>
<ul>
<li>Potash doesn't move in soil so if you want to sprinkle it into the root zone, you have to till it into the root zone.</li>
<li>On average, you should have 1/4 to 1/3 pound of potassium sulfate or potassium chloride per 100 square feet. </li>
<li>To increase the potassium content in your soil, add wood ash to your compost heap.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:red">4.Micronutrient Fertilizers</h3>
<center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Mnz7fZC/micronutrient-fertilizers.jpg" alt="micronutrient-fertilizers" border="0" width="230px"></a></center>
<u><h4 style="color:green">Agricultural Use</h4></u>

<ul>
<li>Micronutrients are essential plant nutrients that are found in trace amounts in tissue, but play an imperative role in plant growth and development.</li>
 <li>Without these nutrients, plant nutrition would be compromised leading to potential declines in plant productivity.</li>
<li>Micronutrients are the fertilizers that are required in very small quantities but are crucial for various plant growth and development processes such as helping in protein synthesis, flowering, fruiting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<u><h4 style="color:green">How to Use Micronutrient Fertilizer?</h4></u>

<ul>
   <li>The best long term way to keep your garden soil rich with the micronutrients it needs is by adding organic compost.</li>
   <li>The living things that go into compost — grass clippings, leaves, plants trimmings, table scraps — already contain various amounts of micronutrients.</li>
  <li>Micronutrients can be tank mixed with liquid fertilizers and pesticides to increase efficacy and reduce chemical reactions between nutrients and other components in the tank.</li> 
  <li>Typically, both root and foliar uptake is strong. </li>
  <li>After spraying with chelated micronutrients, crops can take them up quite quickly</li>
</ul><br/>
<h3 style="color:red">5.Nitrification Inhibitors and Slow Release Fertilizers</h3>
<center><a href="https://ibb.co/6HsmY8q"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5rc6TkJ/nitrification-and-slow-release-inhibitors.png" alt="nitrification-and-slow-release-inhibitors" border="0" width="230px"></a></center>
<u><h4 style="color:green">Agricultural Use</h4></u>
<ul>
    <li>Nitrification inhibitors  are chemical compounds that slow the  nitrification  of ammonia, ammonium-containing, or urea-containing fertilizers, which are applied to soil as fertilizers. </li>  
 <li>Inhibitors  can help reduce losses of nitrogen in soil that would otherwise be used by crops. </li>
   <li>The present invention reports the development and use of potential nitrification inhibitors and their compositions for improving Nitrogen Use Efficiency and a process of obtaining such products. </li>
   <li>The compounds are effective as nitrification inhibitors/ slow N release products and are cost effective.</li>
</ul>
<u><h4 style="color:green">How to Use Nitrification Inhibitors and Slow Release Fertilizer?</h4></u>
<ul>
   <li>Sprinkle slow-release fertilizer around individual perennials.</li>
   <li> While wearing gardening gloves, layer a few spoonfuls of fertilizing granules in a circle around the roots of your flowers and other perennials.</li>
  <li> Try not to place any fertilizer directly on top of the plant, as this will damage your perennials over time.</li>
</ul>
