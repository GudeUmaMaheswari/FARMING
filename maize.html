    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/08/04/14/57/maize-5463051__340.jpg" alt="maize" width="800" height="345" class="center">
    <h4>Introduction:-</h4>
    <p>In India, Maize is grown throughout the year. It is predominantly a kharif crop with 85 per cent of the 
        area under cultivation in the season. Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice 
        and wheat. It accounts for around 10 per cent of total food grain production in the country.
        Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize
         surpassing that of wheat or rice. In addition to being consumed directly by humans 
         (often in the form of masa), maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products,
          such as corn starch and corn syrup.</p>
    <h4>Major Farming Places:-</h4>
    <p>The predominant maize growing states that contributes more than 80 % of the total maize production
         are Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %), Karnataka (16.5 %), Rajasthan (9.9 %), Maharashtra (9.1 %), Bihar (8.9 %),
          Uttar Pradesh (6.1 %), Madhya Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %).</p>
    <h4>Varieties:-</h4>
    <p>About 50 species exist and consist of different colors, textures, and grain shapes and sizes.
         White, yellow, and red are the most common cultivated maize types. The white and yellow varieties
          are preferred by most people depending on the region.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Dent corn</li>
              <li>Flint corn</li>
              <li>Pod corn</li>
              <li>Popcorn</li>
              <li>Flour corn</li>
              <li>Sweet corn.</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Climate:-</h4>
    <p>It is a crop of semi-arid climate and is used both as food and fodder. A temperature of 21degrees- 27degrees 
        and 50-100cm rainfall is suitable for its cultivation. Alternate spells of rains and sunny weather 
        are ideal for maize.
        Maize crop is warm weather loving plant and grows in almost every weather</p>
    <h4>Best Soil:-</h4>
    <p>Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam. However, 
        soils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are 
        considered good for higher productivity.
        The very most basic thing for growing really good crops is good soil. Soil that is not only 
        high in fertility, but is alive with beneficial organisms. The ideal soil for growing corn is 
        deep (six or more feet), medium-textured and loose, well-drained, high in water-holding capacity 
        and organic matter, and able to supply all the nutrients the plant needs. Of course, not everyone 
        has the perfect soil, and corn isn't so fussy that it can't do well on less than ideal soil. But I 
        will show you how to build up your soil so that you can grow much better corn. </p>
    <h4>Land Preparation:-</h4>
    <p> Maize requires a firm and compact seedbed free from stubbles and weed. One deep ploughing should be
        given, followed by two or three harrowings to bring the soil to a fine tilth. Add 10-15 tons of 
        FYM or compost before last harrowing and mix thoroughly with harrow</p>

    <h4>Propagation:-</h4>
    <p>Maize is an out-crossing species normally propagated from seed . Vegetative propagation, however, 
        could be a useful tool in maize research. Mating designs developed for multiflowered plants,
         e.g., Design II of COMSTOCK and ROBINSON (1952), could be carried out with clonal material.
         Usually, meristems, shoot tips, and other vegetative organ/tissue of elite plants seem to be
          selected as original inocula for industrial mass clonal propagation of desired genotypes.</p>
    <h4>Sowing Time:-</h4>
    <p>In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. 
        Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all
         the year round, except December and January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing.
         For market and demand reasons, it is better to start your maize farm within the early planting season. 
         The optimum planting date is between 15th March and 15th May. It is important to understand that 
         the fertility of a soil determines the need for fertilizers or not.</p>
    <h4>Direct Sowing:-</h4>
    <p>Maize is mainly sown directly through seed by using different methods of tillage & establishment. 
        Recently, resource conservation technologies (RCTs) namely, zero tillage, minimum tillage, 
        surface seeding etc. had came in practice in various maize based cropping system and 
        are cost effective and environment friendly.</p>
    <h4>Irrigation/Water Supply:-</h4>
    <p>Maize crop is sensitive to both moisture stress and excessive moisture, hence regulate irrigation 
        according to the requirement. Ensure optimum moisture availability during the most critical phase
         (45 to 65 days after sowing); otherwise yield will be reduced by a considerable extent.
         Furrow irrigation is best used for irrigating row crops such as maize, vegetables and trees. 
         Border irrigation is particularly suitable for close growing crops such as alfalfa, 
         but border irrigation can also be used for row crops and trees.</p>
    <h4>Weed Control:-</h4>
    <p> Weeds damage significantly to maize production and the critical period for crop-weed completion 
        is 15-45 days after sowing.
        Pre-emergence atrazine application followed by one hand weeding at 35-40 days gives good weed control.
        Apply herbicide when there is sufficient moisture in the soil.
        Do not disturb the soil after herbicide application. </p>
    <h4>Maize Based Cropping System:-</h4>
    <p> As maize has wide adaptability and compatibility under diverse soil and climatic conditions and hence 
        it is cultivated in sequence with different crops under various agro-ecologies of the country.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maize-Pea</li>
            <li>Maize-Carrot</li>
            <li>Maize-Cauliflower</li>
            <li>Sugarcane-Maize</li>
            <li>Wheat-Maize</li>
            <li>Maize-potato-wheat</li>
            <li>Maize-potato-sunflower</li>
            <li>Maize-potato-onion</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Manure & Fertilizers:-</h4>
    <p>In Maize crop, apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendation. If soil testing recommendation 
        is not available then adopt the recommendation of 135: 62.5: 50 NPK kg per hectare, ZnSO4 37.5 kg per
         hectare. Apply a quarter of N diet; a full dose of P2O and K2O before sowing.
         Maize can easily achieve 9 tons/ha (40 bags per acre) with the right agronomy and adequate moisture,
          but it does require adequate nutrition to achieve this. The amount of fertilizer required is best 
          calculated by multiplying the target yield in tons per hectare, by 20-25 Kg.
          It has been reported that maize is a heavy feeder of nitrogen and that it requires nitrogen
           application at four weeks after planting.
           The study clearly indicated that cattle manure significantly improved the performances of
            maize and soil fertility proportional with the increased in the rates with 20 t/ha-1 rate giving 
            the best performances.</p>
    <h4>Insect and Pest Control:-</h4>
    <p>There are four major pests of maize prevalent in India. These are spotted stem borer
         [Chilo partellus (Swinhoe)], pink stem borer [Sesamia inferens Walker], shoot fly [Atherigona spp.] 
         and fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda.
         Chemical control of eyespot has proven effective in Maize Growers Association trials. Fungicide mixes 
         such as Comet (Pyraclostrobin) or Quilt Xcel (Azoxystrobin + propiconazole) have been shown to give 
         six weeks protection and delay the eyespot infection. </p>
    <h4>Harvesting:-</h4>
    <p>Image result for harvesting of maize
        Seasons of Maize Kharif are in June to July and August and harvested in December. These are the 
        maize cropping season in India. The major states for Kharif corn farming in India are Andhra Pradesh,
         Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
         The plants are cut and piled up in the shade and the cobs are removed after two or three days of harvesting.
          The dried plants are used for haymaking.Maize grown for fodder are harvested at the milk to early
           dough stage. The earlier harvested crop usually yields less and is poor in protein content.</p>

    <h4>Yield:-</h4>
    <p>Officials said the world average of maize yield was 2,357 kg per acre although it was much higher 
        in the United States of America (USA) at 4,262 kg per acre. In the country, the average maize 
        yield during 2019-20 was 1,973 kg per acre and in Telangana in the last five years yield of maize
         has been 2,600 kg per acre.</p>
