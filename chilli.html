<h4>Introduction:-</h4>
<p>It is known as the most valuable crop of India. It is used as a principle ingredient of various curries and 
    eys, also used in vegetables, spices, condiments, sauces and pickles. Pungency in chillies is due to the 
    active constituent "Capsaicin", an alkaloid. The native home of chilli is considered to be Mexico with 
    secondary origin of Guatemala. Chilli was introduced in India by the Portuguese in Goa in the middle of 
    17th century and since then it had rapidly spread throughout the country. Capsaicin has many medicinal 
    properties, especially as an anti-cancerous agent and instant pain reliever. It also prevents heart 
    diseases by dilating blood vessels. Major chilli growing countries are India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
    Korea, Turkey and Sri Lanka in Asia; Nigeria, Ghana, Tunisia and Egypt in Africa; Mexico, United States of
     America in North & Central America; Yugoslavia, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy and Hungary in Europe and 
     Argentina, Peru and Brazil in South America. India is the world leader in chilli production followed by 
     China & Pakistan.</p>
<h4>Major Farming Places:-</h4>
<p> Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, UP and Rajasthan are the main chilly growing states.
</p>
<h4>Varieties:-</h4>
<ul>
<p>There are about 4,000 varieties of chili in the world. These can be divided into five Capsicum species and a further 28 wild forms.</p>
<li>Guntur Chilli</li>
<li>Byadagi Chilli</li>
<li>Bird's Eye Chili</li>
<li>Bishops Crown Chili</li> 
<li>Piri Piri Chili</li>
<li>Tabasco chili plant</li> 
<li>Bhut Jolokia Chili</li>
<li>Caribbean Red Habanero</li>
<li>Pepperoni Lombardo</li>
<li>Jalapeno Chili Variety</li>
<li>Chili Gorria</li>
</ul>
<h4>Climate:-</h4>
<p>Chillies can be grown under tropical and sub-tropical climates. It can be cultivated upto an altitude of 
    2000m. It grows well in warm and humid climate and a temperature of 20-25Â°C.However, pungent varieties or varieties suited for spices cannot be grown on higher altitudes. 
    A warm humid climate favours growth while warm and dry weather enhances fruit maturity.</p>
<h4>Best Soil:-</h4>
<p>Chilli can be grown in a range of soils, but black soils which retain moisture for long periods are 
    suitable for rainfed crop whereas well drained soils,Chilli can be grown in all type of soft but the sandy-loam, clay loam and loam soils are best suited for it, 
    the soil must be well drained and well aerated. Acidic soils are not suitable for chili cultivation. The land is prepared by giving 2-3 ploughings and clod 
    crushing after each ploughing. deltaic soils and sandy loams are good under 
    irrigated condition. However, in hills of Uttarakhand, chilli are grown in a wide range of soils ranging 
    from sandy to clay loam mixed with gravel and coarse sand.</p>
<h4>Land Preparation:-</h4>
<p>During first ploughing moisture retention capacity of the soil gets increased and land becomes favourable 
    for cultivation. When the land is ploughed there should be enough moisture in the soil. So that with less 
    number of ploughings itself land attains good physical condition. 
    Number and depth of ploughings depends on weed growth intensity in that area, seed rate, nature of crop root growth etc. 
    Summer ploughing is having its own advantages so that summer showers should be better utilised for land preparation. 
    After taking up first ploughing wait for 5 - 10 days then take up further ploughings because the excess moisture in the
    ploughed clods will get evaporated and the soil clods will be in good condition for ploughing which reduces the number of
    ploughings and saves money in land preparation.
    For getting required soil physical condition, after each ploughing, work with gorru so that clod size will be reduced.
    After harvesting the crop, better plough and prepare the land so that effective weed control can be done. </p>

<h4>Propagation:-</h4>
<p>Chilli is propagated by seeds. For raising nurseries, seeds of high yielding varieties with tolerance to
     pests and diseases may be used. They should be carefully selected from certified organic farms or from
      own seed plot which is raised organically.
      Image result for chilli propagation You can take cuttings from any part of your chili pepper plant, 
      but the best cuttings are taken from parts of your pepper plant that are somewhat green but not too
       mature and woody. Whether there are buds, flowers, or peppers on the branch doesn't matter since they
        will all be removed in the process.</p>

<h4>Sowing Time:-</h4>
<p>Chillies can be grown both as Kharif and Rabi crop. In addition they are also planted at other times.
     Sowing months are May to June for Kharif crop, September to October for Rabi crops. If they are grown
      as summer crops then January-February months are chosen.</p>
<h4>Direct Sowing:-</h4>
<p>Direct seeding of chilli under rainfed conditions is recommended in heavy black soils with less weed 
    infestation and better drainage. Sow 2 Â½ kg seed per acre in the last week of July with the help of a 
    seed drill. Before seeding treat the seed with Thiram or Dithane M-45 @ 3g/kg of seed.</p>

<h4>Irrigation/Water Supply:-</h4>
<p>Heavy soils : 10-15 days interval. Summer : 5-6 days interval. After every harvesting of chilli one 
    irrigation should be provided (as per the moisture regime of soils) Irrigation should be provided at
     40-60% depletion of available soil moisture.
     Under limited water availability conditions provide irrigation only at important critical stages of crop 
     so that the yield reduction is not substantial and the water use efficiency is very high.
     While irrigating chilli crop in heavy soil care should be exercised that they should not be water 
     stagnation even for few hours </p>
<h4>Weed Control:-</h4>
<p>A weed is "an unwanted and harmful plant growing where it is not desired or a plant growing out of place
     which interferes with crop for solar radiation, water, nutrients and space, reduces yield, quality and
      marketability of the produce besides increasing cost of cultivation. </p>
      <ul>
          <p>Methods of weed control:-</p>
          <li>Timely sowing of chilli gives vigorous crop growth quick canopy coverage - suppress weeds. </li>
          <li>Band or pocket application of N-fertilizer to chilli reduces the nutrient availability for weed growth.
            Sowing certified seed. </li>
          <li>Adopt furrow method of irrigation</li>
          <li>Raising chilli in paired rows and utilising the interspace effectively by cultivating intercrops
               like onion, greengram, bhendi etc., is found useful not only to reduce the incidence of weeds 
               but also to obtain additional income per unit area.</li>
          <li>Proper crop rotation is highly useful for control of perennial weeds. </li>
      </ul>
<h4>Manures & Fertilizers:-</h4>
<p>Compost and horse manure are good organic fertilizers for chillies grown organically.
     Horse manure is spread on the vegetable bed and dug up. Mist bed compost has a good long-term 
     effect as the components rot only slowly. During decomposition, the nutrient is first made accessible
      to the plants.</p>
<h4>Insect and Pest Control:-</h4>
<p>The pest can be effectively controlled by spraying with 0.05% endosulfan, 0.03% dimethoate,
     0.02% phosphamidon or 0.05% monocrotophos. Addition of sulphur in chlorinated hydrocarbon 
     insecticides in equal proportion would control mites also.</p>
<h4>Harvesting:-</h4>
<p>Harvesting can be done 75 days after transplanting. First two picking yield green chilli and 
    subsequently yield red ripe fruits.The harvesting of chilli is done according to the intended use of chillies.
    For making powdered chilli and dry chilli, fruits are harvested when the chilli turns dark red in color.
    The green chilli is plucked for preparing pickles.
    Plucking should be done at regular intervals.</p>

<h4>Yield:-</h4>
<p>The yield varies according to the system of cultivation. The yield of dry chillies of rain fed crop is 
    200-400 kg and that of irrigated crop is 600-1000 kg per acre. The proportion of dry to fresh japed 
    chillies varies from25- to 40 per cent.</p>
