<h4>Introduction:-</h4>
<p>Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food. 
    The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat
    Image result for introduction about wheat crop
    wheat, any of several species of cereal grasses of the genus Triticum (family Poaceae) and their edible 
    grains. Wheat is one of the oldest and most important of the cereal crops. Of the thousands of varieties
     known, the most important are common wheat (Triticum aestivum), used to make bread; durum wheat </p>
<h4>Major Farming Places:-</h4>
<p>Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat are main wheat growing regions.</p>
<h4>Varieties:-</h4>
<p>There are around 20 wheat varieties of 7 species grown throughout the world</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hard Red Winter:
        Hard Red Winter has its roots firmly planted in the Great Plains (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado
         and Nebraska) and is scattered a bit in other states, as well. It’s an extremely versatile wheat that
          is great for bread and all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Hard Red Spring:
        Hard Red Spring comes primarily from the Northern States (Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota and
         Minnesota). Sometimes referred to as the “aristocrat of wheat,” it’s great for designer breads, 
         bagels, croissants and more.</li>
    <li>Soft Red Winter:
        Soft Red Winter is found mostly east of the Mississippi River. For you cookie monsters out there,
         this is the wheat for you! It’s great for cookies, crackers, pretzels and pastries!</li>
    <li>Soft White:
        West Coast represent! Soft White Wheat calls the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon and Idaho) 
        its home. This wheat creates mouth-watering cakes, pastries and Middle Eastern flatbreads.</li>
    <li>Hard White:
        This is the newest class of U.S. wheat! Hard white shares its territory with Hard Red Winter wheat, 
        but is grown on a much smaller scale. This class is great for Asian Noodles (ramen, anyone?) tortillas
         and flatbreads.</li>
    <li>Durum:
        Durum is for you pasta lovers out there! It’s grown primarily in Montana and North Dakota with 
        a smidge grown in Arizona, California and South Dakota. This wheat has a high protein (aka gluten) 
        content that is perfecto for pasta and couscous.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Climate:-</h4>
<p>It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone
     and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude.
      Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring.</p>
<h4>Best Soil:-</h4>
<p>Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are 
    ideal for wheat cultivation.Wheat needs an adequate amount of water to grow. 
    It also needs warm temperatures and a lot of sunshine.
     It cannot thrive in soils with high acidity or insufficient water drainage.
     The best soil for growing wheat is soil that is loamy and well draining. Loam is soil that has the right
      combination of clay, silt and sand to provide a proper balance of moisture retention and moisture release.</p>
<h4>Land Preparation:-</h4>
<p>Plough twice with an iron plough and two to three times with cultivator and prepare the land to a fine tilth.
     Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost on the unploughed field. Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram
      at 2 g/kg of seeds 24 hours before sowing. Image result for land preparation for wheat crop
      The soil having pH 5-7 is considered good for its cultivation. During land preparation,
       one ploughing should be done with MB plow and 2-3 ploughing with harrow or cultivator.
        After this, the land should be leveled after every ploughing. When preparing the field, apply enough
         cow dung in the soil.</p>

<h4>Propagation:-</h4>
<p>Wheat seeds can be sown by hand broadcasting in smaller areas, or using a hand-cranked seeder. 
    Seeds are usually sown to at depths ranging from 2 to 12 cm (0.8-4.7 in) depending on soil conditions
     (seed must be sown deeper in drier soil).</p>
<h4>Sowing Time:-</h4>
<p>Sowing is done with the help of a small implement known as 'Dibbler'. It is a wooden or iron frame with pegs.
     The frame is pressed in the field and lifted and then one or two seeds are dropped by hand in each of
      the hole. It is not a common method because it is a very time consuming process.
      wheat is grown during the winter or rabi season. The crop is sown during November-December
       and harvested around April.</p>
<h4>Direct Sowing:-</h4>
<p>Direct sowing with happy seeder is cost-effective as after paddy harvesting with super SMS-attached 
    combine harvester, which cuts the stubble and spreads them evenly on the field, farmers can sow wheat 
    without even clearing the residue.</p>
<h4>Irrigation/Water Supply:-</h4>
<p>The crop requires 4 - 6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall. Wheat crop requires minimum 
    of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages. Crown root initiation and flowering are the most
     critical stages. Water stagnation should be avoided at the time of germination.
     Wheat can be produced successfully with a variety of irrigation systems. Drip and sprinkler 
     irrigation systems can apply smaller amounts of water than surface flood systems, and therefore, 
     less applied water moves past the root zone. Frequent irrigation with sprinkler systems can result 
     in rapid disease development.</p>

<h4>Weed Control:-</h4>
<p>Methabenzthiazuron @ 0.75-1.50 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> or Metoxuron @ 1.2-1.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>: The two 
    herbicides can be used both for pre and post emergence treatment. Pendimethaline @ 1.0-1.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>:In
     mustered-wheat inter-cropping croppigh systems, pre-emergent pendimethaline can be used to cotrol grass 
     weeds.</p>

     <li>Criss-cross sowing</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Manures & Fertilizers:-</h4>
<p>In general, wheat is considered a highly responsive crop to starter fertilizers, particularly phosphorus
     and nitrogen, he said. When applying a starter fertilizer for wheat, application methods and rates are
      much more flexible with phosphorus than nitrogen.
      If manure is being considered ahead of fall planting of wheat, manure can be an excellent source of
       P for achieving optimum yields. Phosphorus increases tillering in the fall resulting in increased 
       number of heads and grain yield.</p>
<h4>Insect and Pest Control:-</h4>
    <p>The major diseases in wheat cultivation in India are yellow and stem rust,powdery mildew,three rusts-leaf,
        Foliar blights,Karnal bunt and loose smut.These practices include cultural control, planting pest resistant varieties and using selective
     insecticides when other practices fail to keep pest numbers below the economic threshold.</p>
<h4>Harvesting:-</h4>
<p>Harvesting stage comes when normally the plant turns golden yellow and becomes brittle. The grains become 
    hard and the straw turns dry. The crop should be harvested at physiological maturity when the grain 
    moisture is around 19-20%.
The wheat crop is harvested after the straw becomes dry, brittle and wheat graings harden.The harvesting season 
time varies from zone to zone.Compared to Irrigated crops,Rain fed crops reach the harvesting stage much earlier.
To keep the pests away,godowns,storage pits and bins should be fumigated and moisture free.</p>

<h4>Yield:-</h4>
<p>3 components determine yield: Heads per Acre, Grains per Head, and Weight per Grain.High yields come from
     achieving the correct leaf and shoot numbers, maintaining a green leaf canopy, increasing grain 
     numbers/ear and grain size. A balanced crop nutrition programme including all macro and micro nutrients 
     is essential to help manage all of these components.</p>
