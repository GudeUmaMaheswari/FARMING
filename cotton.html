<h4>Introduction:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of 
    the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure 
    cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water.
It provides the basic raw material to the cotton textile industry.Cotton in India provides a direct
 livelihood to 6million farmers and about 40-50 million people are employed in the cotton trade and its processing.
 The value of cotton is an important measure of agricultural productivity because it measures the economic output of farms. 
 Cotton is a significant crop; it is the most commonly used natural fiber, and it accounts for 1/3 of the world's fiber demand.</p>
 <h4>Major Farming Places:-</h4>
 <p>Cotton is a Kharif crop in the major parts of the country viz. Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, 
     Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh & Karnataka. In these areas, the irrigated 
     crop is sown from March-May and the rain fed crop in June-July with the commencement of the monsoon.</p>
<h4>Types:-</h4>
<p>The varietal improvement work got momentum with the
    inception of All India Coordinated Cotton Improvement Project (AICCIP) in April, 1967. After inception of
    AICCIP, 90 varieties of upland cotton, 3 of Egyptian cotton, 39 of diploid cottons and 43 hybrids have
    been released for commercial cultivation in different states of India</p>

<ol>
    <li><h6>Long Staple Cotton:-</h6>It has he fiber is long,fine and shining.It is used for making fine and superior 
        quality cloth,It fetches the best price.It is Largely grown in Punjab,Haryana,Maharastra,Gujarat and 
        Andhra Pradesh ,the longest fiber whose length varies from 24 to 27mm.T</li>
    <li><h6>Short Staple Cotton:-</h6>This is inferior cotton with fiber less than 20mm long.It is used for 
        manufacturing inferior cloth and fetches less price.About 6 percent of the total production is of short staple cotton
    U.P,Andhra Pradesh,Telangana,Rajasthan,Haryana and Punjab are its main producers.</li>
    <li><h6>Medium Staple Cotton:-</h6>The length of its fiber is between 20 mm and 24 mm.About 44 percent of the
         total cotton production in India is of the medium staple.Rajasthan,Punjab,Tamil Nadu,Madhya Pradesh,
         Uttar Pradesh,Karnataka and Maharastra are its main producers</li>
</ol>
<h4>Climate:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is a tropical crop and it is raised in India as a Kharif crop. Cotton requires uniformly high temperature between 
    21 degree Celsius and 30 degree Celsius. During October, the day temperature should be above 26 degree Celsius which helps 
    the ripening and bursting of cotton balls under the sunny skies.</p>
<h4>Best Soil:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is best grown in soils with an excellent water holding capacity. Aeration and good drainage are equally important as 
    the crop cannot withstand excessive moisture and water logging. The major soil types suitable for cotton cultivation are
     alluvial, clayey and red sandy loam.
     Black cotton soil is also called as regular soil.
     Black soils are derivatives of trapped lava. These are found mostly across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and 
     Madhya Pradesh on the Deccan lava plateau and the Malwa Plateau, where there is both moderate rainfall and underlying
      basaltic rock.Cotton is grown well in this soil.</p>
<h4>Land Preparation:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two harrowings. 
    Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton shallow ridges on 90cm 
    spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation.</p>

<h4>Propagation:-</h4>
<p>Planting Cotton is propagated from seed by planting directly in a prepared field when growing conditions are favorable 
    (suitable temperature, adequate rainfall etc). Cotton should only be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 18.3<sup>0</sup>C.</p>
<h4>Sowing Time:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is a Kharif crop in the major parts of the country viz. Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, 
    Gujarat, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh & Karnataka. In these areas, the irrigated crop is sown from March-May 
    and the rain fed crop in June-July with the commencement of the monsoon.
    which requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Its time of sowing and harvesting differs in different parts of the country 
    depending upon the climatic conditions. </p>
<h4>Irrigation/Water Supply:-</h4>
<p>Image result for irrigation of cotton crop
    Sprinkler irrigation systems-where center pivots are the type most commonly used for cotton production;
     Surface irrigation-applying the water down the furrow from siphon tubes or poly-pipe as well as flooding an irrigation basin; 
     Drip irrigation-surface or subsurface.</p>
<h4>Weed Control:-</h4>
<p> Apply Pendimethalin @ 3.3 l/ha three days after sowing, using a hand operated sprayer fitted with deflecting or fan
     type nozzle. Sufficient moisture should be present in the soil at the time of herbicide application. This will ensure weed 
     free condition upto 40 days.</p>
<h4>Manures & Fertilizers:-</h4>
<p>The most commonly used fertilizer in cotton production is Nitrogen because of its high demand by the plant and its low availability in the soil.
    Apply two foliar applications of 5-10 lbs/K2O in each application during early bloom (first thru 4th week of bloom).
     To avoid K deficiency; 1) soil test, 2) apply the recommended K fertilizer at planting, and 3) consider foliar feeding
      K during peak bloom.16-May-2018
</p>
<h4>Insect and Pest Control:-</h4>
<p>Cotton crop is infested with different kinds of insects in the production cycle. Jassids, thrips, aphids and whiteflies 
    are among sucking pests and bollworm (American and spotted) and spodoptera caterpillars which attack on leaves and bolls.</p>
    <h6>Cultural Control:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Sow the crop early.</li>
        <li>Use resistant varieties such as Khandwa-2 or the varieties having leaves rich in tannin contents.</li>
        <li>Do not use high doses of nitrogenous fertilizers.</li>
        <li>Grow cowpea/onion/soybean as an intercrop in cotton to reduce early stage pest.</li>
        <li>Use Okra as a trap crop.</li>
        <li>Adopt proper crop rotation.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Harvesting:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is fully mature and ready for harvesting approximately 160 days after being planted. Once the bolls have burst open,
     the farmers can prepare the cotton plants for harvesting. This occurs in mid-July for the southern parts of Texas, and 
     in early September for the northern parts of the cotton belt.
     Image result for harvesting of cotton crop
     Cotton picking machines have spindles that pick (twist) the seed cotton from the burrs that are attached to plants' stems. 
     Doffers then remove the seed cotton from the spindles and knock the seed cotton into the conveying system. 
     alternating bats and brushes to knock the open bolls from the plants into a conveyor.</p>

<h4>Yield:-</h4>
<p>Cotton is an important crop and commodity produced in the Indian subcontinent. At the end of fiscal year 2021,
     the yield of cotton produced in the country was estimated to be around 462 kilograms per hectare, a significant 
     increase from the previous fiscal year.</p>
